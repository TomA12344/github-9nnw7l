# Building Accessible Web Applications

Web accessibility is not just a nice-to-have feature—it's a necessity. Creating accessible web applications ensures that all users, regardless of their abilities, can effectively use your website.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility benefits everyone:

- People with disabilities
- Mobile device users
- Older users
- Users with temporary limitations
- Search engine optimization

## Semantic HTML: The Foundation

Using semantic HTML is crucial for accessibility:

```html
<!-- Instead of -->
<div class="button" onclick="submit()">Submit</div>

<!-- Use -->
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

Key semantic elements:
- `<nav>`
- `<main>`
- `<article>`
- `<section>`
- `<aside>`
- `<header>`
- `<footer>`

## ARIA Roles and Attributes

When HTML semantics aren't enough, ARIA helps:

```html
<div role="alert" aria-live="polite">
  Form submitted successfully!
</div>
```

Common ARIA patterns:
- Navigation landmarks
- Form labels
- Dynamic content updates
- Modal dialogs

## Keyboard Navigation

Ensure your site works without a mouse:

- Logical tab order
- Visible focus indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Skip links

## Color and Contrast

Make your content visible to all:

- Sufficient color contrast
- Don't rely on color alone
- Support high contrast modes
- Test with color blindness simulators

## Testing Accessibility

Tools and techniques for testing:

1. Automated testing tools
   - WAVE
   - aXe
   - Lighthouse

2. Manual testing
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen readers
   - Browser extensions

## Conclusion

Building accessible web applications is an essential part of modern web development. By following these guidelines and best practices, you can create inclusive experiences that work for everyone.

Remember: accessibility is not a feature—it's a requirement for creating truly universal web applications.
